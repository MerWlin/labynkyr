 *
 * SearchTaskRunner is an interface for defining sequential enumeration tasks that may be run in parallel.
 *
 * An instance of a SearchTaskRunner will be placed on a queue and made available to PEUs.  A PEU will take the instance from the queue,
 * and call the processSequentially(KeyVerifier &) function with the PEUs internal KeyVerifier.  Once this call is complete, the
 * PEU will place the instance onto an output queue.
 *
 * This approach decouples the PEU from needing to know how to execute the enumeration task.
 *
 * @tparam VecCount the number of distinguishing vectors in the attack (e.g 16 for SubBytes attacks on an AES-128 key)
 * @tparam VecLenBits the number bits of the key targeted by each subkey recovery attack (e.g 8 for SubBytes attacks on an AES-128 key)
 * @tparam WeightType the integer type used to store weights (e.g uint32_t)
 * @tparam SubkeyType the integer type used to store a subkey valyue (e.g uint8_t for a typical 8-bit DPA attack)
