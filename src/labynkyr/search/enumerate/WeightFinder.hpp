 * WeightFinder provides a method to find the closest weight for a specified rank.  This is needed to pick weight boundaries for enumeration
 * budgets -- for example, if I wish to enumerate the first 2^50 keys, then I need to know the weight Wmax, and will then check all keys
 * with 1 <= weight < Wmax.
 *
 * This can be achieved using a rank estimation algorithm taking the maximum weight in the table as input.  This will produce a list containing
 * the number of keys with each unique weight.  By binary searching across this list, we can pick the best weight for a required rank.
 *
 * @tparam VecCount the number of distinguishing vectors in the attack (e.g 16 for SubBytes attacks on an AES-128 key)
 * @tparam VecLenBits the number bits of the key targeted by each subkey recovery attack (e.g 8 for SubBytes attacks on an AES-128 key)
 * @tparam WeightType the integer type used to score weights (e.g uint32_t)
