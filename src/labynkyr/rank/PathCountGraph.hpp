/**
 *
 * A representation of the "path count" graph traversed by the rank estimation algorithm, providing
 * implementations of functions to calculate the indexes of the left and right child nodes for a given coordinate.
 *
 * The graph is restricted to be 64 bits in size as uint64_t is used as the indexing type.  This requires that the retained precision
 * from the distinguishing scores is at the very most 60-62 bits.  As the entire graph must be traversed by the algorithm, in practice
 * the retained precision is likely to have to be capped at <= 32 bits for efficiency reasons.
 *
 * This is the fastest implementation of the PathCountRank algorithm, in addition to requiring the least memory.
 *
 * The optimisation stems from being able to automatically capture the role of the leftChild function through summation with
 * the existing value in the graph when the set() function is called (rather than overriding).
 *
 * This typically offers a significant speed-up.
 *
 * Storage: 2*W for W = the weight of the correct key
 *
 * @tparam VecCount the number of distinguishing vectors in the attack (e.g 16 for SubBytes attacks on an AES-128 key)
 * @tparam VecLenBits the number bits of the key targeted by each subkey recovery attack (e.g 8 for SubBytes attacks on an AES-128 key)
 * @tparam WeightType the integer type used to score weights (e.g uint32_t)
