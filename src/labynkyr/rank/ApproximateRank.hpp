/**
 *
 * Static method for approximating the rank for a global key by multiplying together the rank values of the individual subkeys.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The notion of rank here is slightly different: in a perfect attack on a subkey (where the correct subkey
 * value has the 'best' score, the rank of the correct subkey in that vector is 1 and NOT 0.  If there are two better subkeys,
 * then the correct subkey has rank 3 and NOT 2. This is necessary to allow for the multiplication of each subkey rank.
 *
 * In the case of ties, the number ties do not count towards the rank.  E.g. if three keys, including the true one, have the
 * same highest(/best) distinguishing score, then the rank of the correct key is still 1, and is not 3.
 *
 * @tparam VecCount the number of distinguishing vectors in the attack (e.g 16 for SubBytes attacks on an AES-128 key)
 * @tparam VecLenBits the number bits of the key targeted by each subkey recovery attack (e.g 8 for SubBytes attacks on an AES-128 key)
 * @tparam ScoresType the floating-point type of the distinguishing scores (e.g float or double)
