 *
 * The integer representation of the distinguishing scores should ideally be positive integers.  Technically, as long as the
 * sum of the integer scores for the correct key is positive, the algorithm is correct, but for safety it is likely easier
 * to ensure all values are >= 1.
 *
 * IMPORTANT - definitions of 'rank':
 * 		- The rank is defined as the number of keys with a better distinguishing score.  Thus, a perfect attack is rank 0.
 * 		- In the case of ties, the number of ties do not count towards the rank.  E.g. if three keys, including the true one, have the
 * 		  same (best) distinguishing score, then the rank of the correct key is still 0, and is not 3.
 *
 * @tparam VecCount the number of distinguishing vectors in the attack (e.g 16 for SubBytes attacks on an AES-128 key)
 * @tparam VecLenBits the number bits of the key targeted by each subkey recovery attack (e.g 8 for SubBytes attacks on an AES-128 key)
 * @tparam WeightType the integer type used to store weights (e.g uint32_t)
