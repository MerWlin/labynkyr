 *
 * A WeightTable contains the positive integer representation of the distinguishing scores associated with all the DPA attacks with the recovery
 * of a full key.  In this implementation we assume each attack targets the same size portion of the key (e.g. 16 8-bit SubBytes attack
 * on AES, and not 12 8-bit SubBytes and one 32-bit MixColumns attack)
 *
 * A WeightTable can be created using the DistinguishingTable#mapToWeight(uint32_t precisionBits) method.
 *
 * The weights are stored internally in a single vector, with the weights for the first distinguishing vector stored first in the buffer,
 * the second distinguishing vector in the next portion of the buffer, and so on.
 *
 * This class is templated on the integer type itself; if less than 32-bits or 16-bits of precision are required by the
 * ranking algorithm, then it makes sense to use uint16_t or uint32_t here.
 *
 * Higher distinguishing scores should have lower integer weights! The scores which correspond to more likely key candidates should
 * be mapped to smaller integer weights
 *
 * @tparam VecCount the number of distinguishing vectors in the attack (e.g 16 for SubBytes attacks on an AES-128 key)
 * @tparam VecLenBits the number bits of the key targeted by each subkey recovery attack (e.g 8 for SubBytes attacks on an AES-128 key)
 * @tparam WeightType the integer type used to store the weights (e.g. uint32_t)
