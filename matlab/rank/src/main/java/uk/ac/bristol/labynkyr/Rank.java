	/**
	 * 
	 * Basic Java implementation of the path-counting rank estimation algorithm of Martin et al.:
	 *
	 * 		How to Enumerate Your Keys Accurately and Efficiently After a Side Channel Attack.
	 * 		Daniel P. Martin, Jonathan F. O'Connell, Elisabeth Oswald, Martijn Stam
	 * 		ASIACRYPT (2) 2015: 313-337 (2015)
	 *
	 * with improvements from:
	 *
	 *		Characterisation and Estimation of the Key Rank Distribution in the Context of Side Channel Evaluations.
	 * 		Daniel P. Martin, Luke Mather, Elisabeth Oswald, Martijn Stam
	 *		IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive 2016: 491 (2016)
	 *
	 * The intended purpose of this Java implementation is to provide a manageable way to allow the estimation of key ranks directly from a 
	 * Matlab environment.  To this end, the functionality implemented is the minimum possible, and the code is not optimised for speed.  If 
	 * speed is important, please use the C++ implementation (or if performing a performance evaluation with a different rank estimation 
	 * algorithm).
	 *
	 * The provided distinguishing scores must meet the following criteria:
	 * 		(1) The most likely subkey candidate must have the *lowest* score;
	 * 		(2) The scores need to be additive;
	 * To meet conditions 1 & 2 using data produced by a correlation attack, consider taking the absolute value of the correlation coefficients,
	 * then taking the logarithm, and then taking the absolute value again.
	 * 
	 * To call this code from Matlab, having added the JAR to the classpath, use something similar to 
	 *		logRank = uk.ac.bristol.labynkyr.Rank.rankKey(key, precisionBits, vectorCount, vectorSizeBits, scores);
	 * where key is a standard Matlab string, precisionBits, vectorCount and vectorSizeBits are of the uint32 type, and scores is a standard Matlab
	 * double precision vector.
	 *
	 * IMPORTANT - definitions of 'rank':
	 * 		- The rank is defined as the number of keys with a better distinguishing score.  Thus, a perfect attack is rank 0.
	 * 		- In the case of ties, the number of ties do not count towards the rank.  E.g. if three keys, including the true one, have the
	 * 		  same (best) distinguishing score, then the rank of the correct key is still 0, and is not 3.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * @param keyHex the key as a hexadecimal string
	 * @param precisionBits the bits of precision retained when converting distinguishing scores to integer values.  ~16 is a
	 * reasonable number.  Larger values produce more accurate rank & enumeration calculations but at the cost of speed.  This Java implementation
	 * is not optimised and will struggle at higher values of precision.  In such cases, consider using the C++ variant of the code.
	 * @param vectorCount the number of distinguishing vectors in the attack (e.g 16 for SubBytes attacks on an AES-128 key)
	 * @param vectorSizeBits the number bits of the key targeted by each subkey recovery attack (e.g 8 for SubBytes attacks on an AES-128 key)
	 * @param scores an array of the distinguishing scores.  The scores corresponding to the subkey candidates for the first distinguishing vector
	 * should appear first, the scores for the second distinguishing vector should follow, and so on
	 * @return log_2(rank) of the key, given the distinguishing scores.
	 * @throws DecoderException
