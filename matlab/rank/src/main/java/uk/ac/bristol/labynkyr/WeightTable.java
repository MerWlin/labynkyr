/**
*
* A WeightTable contains the integer representation of the distinguishing scores associated with all the DPA attacks with the recovery
* of a full key.  In this implementation we assume each attack targets the same size portion of the key (e.g. 16 8-bit SubBytes attack
* on AES, and not 12 8-bit SubBytes and one 32-bit MixColumns attack)
*
* A WeightTable can be created using the DistinguishingTable#mapToWeight(uint32_t precisionBits) method.
*
* The weights are stored internally in a single vector, with the weights for the first distinguishing vector stored first in the buffer,
* the second distinguishing vector in the next portion of the buffer, and so on.
*
* This class is templated on the integer type itself; if less than 32-bits or 16-bits of precision are required by the
* ranking algorithm, then it makes sense to use uint16_t or uint32_t here.
*
* Higher distinguishing scores should have lower integer weights!
