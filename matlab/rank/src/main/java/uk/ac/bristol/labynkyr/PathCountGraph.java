/**
*
* A representation of the "path count" graph traversed by the rank estimation algorithm, providing
* implementations of functions to calculate the indexes of the left and right child nodes for a given coordinate.
*
* The graph is restricted to be 64 bits in size as uint64_t is used as the indexing type.  This requires that the retained precision
* from the distinguishing scores is at the very most 60-62 bits.  As the entire graph must be traversed by the algorithm, in practice
* the retained precision is likely to have to be capped at <= 32 bits for efficiency reasons.
*
* This is the fastest implementation of the PathCountRank algorithm, in addition to requiring the least memory.
*
* The optimisation stems from being able to automatically capture the role of the leftChild function through summation with
* the existing value in the graph when the set() function is called (rather than overriding).
*
* This typically offers a significant speed-up.
*
* Storage: 2*W for W = the weight of the correct key
