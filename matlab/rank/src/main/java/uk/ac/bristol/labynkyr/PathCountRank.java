* The integer representation of the distinguishing scores should ideally be positive integers.  Technically, as long as the
* sum of the integer scores for the correct key is non-zero, the algorithm is correct, but for safety it is likely easier
* to ensure all values are >= 1.
*
* IMPORTANT - definitions of 'rank':
* 		- The rank is defined as the number of keys with a better distinguishing score.  Thus, a perfect attack is rank 0.
* 		- In the case of ties, the number of ties do not count towards the rank.  E.g. if three keys, including the true one, have the
* 		  same (best) distinguishing score, then the rank of the correct key is still 0, and is not 3.
